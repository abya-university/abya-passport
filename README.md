## `ABYA Passport`: A Multichain Decentralized Identity for Lifelong Learning

`ABYA Passport` is a multichain decentralized identity (DID) platform designed to empower learners with secure, verifiable, and privacy-preserving digital credentials that they fully own and control. It addresses the fragmentation, inefficiency, and lack of trust in traditional credentialing systems by leveraging blockchain technology, W3C standards, and zero-knowledge proofs.

## The Problem

Learners today accumulate credentials from various institutions and platforms, but these records are often siloed, unverifiable, and prone to fraud. There is no unified, learner-owned system that allows secure sharing and verification of educational achievements across different ecosystems. Additionally, most identity systems are centralized, compromising user privacy and control.

## The Solution

ABYA Passport introduces a multichain DID system that allows learners to:

- Create decentralized identities using DID methods like did:icp, did:ethr, did:key, and did:web.
- Receive W3C-compliant Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for achievements such as course completions, certifications, and skills.
- Share credentials securely via QR codes or DIDComm protocols.
- Verify credentials across chains using a Universal Resolver and multichain anchoring.
- Preserve privacy through selective disclosure using zero-knowledge proofs (e.g., BBS+ signatures).

## Tech Stack

**`Smart Contracts`**: Motoko (ICP) and Solidity (EVM) for credential anchoring.
**`Authentication`**: Internet Identity (ICP), MetaMask, Phantom, Keplr.
**`DID Methods`**: did:icp, did:key, did:ethr, did:web.
**`Credential Format`**: W3C Verifiable Credentials.
**`Privacy Layer`**: ZKPs (e.g., BBS+, zk-SNARKs).
**`Storage`**: On-chain metadata + IPFS/Filecoin for encrypted credential storage.
**`Frontend`**: React with ICP Agent and EVM wallet connectors.

## Innovation Highlights

**`Cross-chain interoperability`**: Works seamlessly across ICP, Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.
**`User sovereignty`**: Learners own and control their identity and credentials.
**`AI-powered insights (bonus)`**: Recommends learning paths based on verified credentials.
**`Reputation layer (bonus)`**: Builds a non-transferable, on-chain reputation for learners and educators.

## Use Cases

- **`Learners`**: Manage and share credentials across platforms and employers.
- **`Educators`**: Issue tamper-proof credentials.
- **`Employers`**: Instantly verify qualifications and reduce credential fraud.
